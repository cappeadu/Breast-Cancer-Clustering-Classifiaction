Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers, characterized by the formation of tumors from abnormal breast cells. This type of cancer predominantly affects women, although 0.5–1% of cases occur in men, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023. To enhance early detection and treatment, unsupervised machine learning techniques and algorithms have gained considerable attention within the healthcare sector.

This study applies KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to analyze the grouping patterns of cell nuclei, offering insights into the classification of nuclei as either malignant or benign. 

Additionally, five supervised machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier—are employed to classify cells as malignant or benign, providing a robust framework for supporting breast cancer diagnosis.
